# KnowYourself
An app that transparently uses weather, sleep and location data and manually inserted stress data to predict the future well being of its user. I've developed this project a couple of years ago and it can be improved with serious object oriented programming and a good software architecture. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather and its forecast and the Smile Machine Learning library.
As this is an AndroidStudio project, most of the source files are in MobileVersion/app/src/main/java/ including the piece of Smile library ported to Android and my own code for this project.
